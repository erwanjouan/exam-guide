                ### Practicing Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery on AWS
                - [Deployment methods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/practicing-continuous-integration-continuous-delivery/deployment-methods.html)

                ### __In-Place Deployments__
                Updates the application version without replacing any infrastructure components. Basically, all the instances are stopped, and then the latest version is installed.
                #### Pros
                - Do not need new infrastructure
                - Minimizes infrastructure costs and management overhead
                #### Cons
                - Application availability is affected
                - Rollback (You need to install again the old version)
                ### __Blue/Green Deployments__
                In this strategy, you have two separate but identical environments (Environment Blue and Green). 
                - __[Environment Green]__: running current application version; 
                - __[Environment Blue]__: running the new application version.
                #### Pros
                - Application availability is not affected
                - Reduces deployment risk (easy rollback, just need to swap URL)
                - Zero downtime
                #### Cons
                - Deployment time
                - Extra cost

                After the green environment is ready and tested, production traffic is redirected from blue to green. If any problem is found, you can redirect the traffic to the blue environment again.

                ### __Canary Deployments__
                This is a subset of Blue/Green deployment. The only difference is, you redirect just a percentage of the users for the green environment (could be 10% or something), the other users (90%) stays in the blue environment. If the green environment is not operating as expected, you can route the 10% traffic back to the blue environment. The big advantage of this strategy, only a small percentage of the users were impacted.
                #### Pros
                - Application availability is not affected
                - Reduces deployment risk (easy rollback, just need to swap URL)
                - Zero downtime
                - Just a small percentage of the users are impacted if the new environment is not working as expected.
                #### Cons
                - Deployment time
                - Extra cost

                ### __Linear Deployments__
                This is a subset of Blue/Green deployment. Just like canary deployment, but with this strategy the traffic is shifted in equal increments with an equal number of minutes between each increment. Something like every 3 minutes 10% of traffic will be shifted from Blue to Green environment until achieving 100%.
                #### Pros
                - Application availability is not affected
                - Reduces deployment risk (easy rollback, just need to swap URL)
                - Zero downtime
                - Just a small percentage of the users are impacted if the new environment is not working as expected.
                #### Cons
                - Deployment time
                - Extra cost

                ### __All-at-once Deployments__
                This is another subset of Blue/Green deployment, but all traﬃc is shifted from the original task set to the updated task set all at once, instead of shift the traffic in small steps.
                #### Pros
                - Application availability is not affected
                - Reduces deployment risk (easy rollback, just need to swap URL)
                - Zero downtime
                #### Cons
                - Deployment time (Within the Blue/Green deployments this is the faster one)
                - Extra cost

                - [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html)
                  - E.g.
                    - When a scale-out event occurs, your newly launched instance completes its startup sequence and transitions to a wait state. While the instance is in a wait state, it runs a script to download and install the needed software packages for your application, making sure that your instance is fully ready before it starts receiving traffic. When the script is finished installing software, it sends the complete-lifecycle-action command to continue. (state=Pending:Wait)
                    - When a scale-in event occurs, a lifecycle hook pauses the instance before it is terminated and sends you a notification using Amazon EventBridge. While the instance is in the wait state, you can invoke an AWS Lambda function or connect to the instance to download logs or other data before the instance is fully terminated. (state=Terminating:Wait)

                - [__Recovery Time Objective (RTO)__](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/disaster-recovery-dr-objectives.html)
                  - Defined by the organization. RTO is the maximum acceptable delay between the interruption of service and restoration of service. This determines what is considered an acceptable time window when service is unavailable.
                - [__Recovery Point Objective (RPO)__](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/disaster-recovery-dr-objectives.html)
                  - Defined by the organization. RPO is the maximum acceptable amount of time since the last data recovery point. This determines what is considered an acceptable loss of data between the last recovery point and the interruption of service.
                - [__Availability__](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/availability.html)
                  - is the percentage of time that a workload is available for use. 
                - [__Resiliency__](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/resiliency-and-the-components-of-reliability.html)
                  -  is the ability of a workload to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions, such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.

                - [Guidance for Log Storage on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/log-storage-on-aws/)
                  - Log storage must be tamper-resistant and encrypted, and accessed only by controlled and monitored mechanisms, based on least privilege access by role.
                #### Build a secure and resilient log storage
                - Secure access to log storage
                - Configure default encryption on log storage
                - Create a place to store your logs
                #### Store logs centrally
                - Capture audit trails logs in central location
                - Capture resource configuration changes in a central location
                - Generate logs at an organization-defined frequency
                #### Ensuring the integrity of logs within your log storage
                - Set preventive controls to prevent unauthorized access and modification of the logs
                - Generate and store access logs to your log storage
                #### Managing your logs in your log storage
                - Create a policy document that specifies the length of time logs must be kept
                - Automate log rotation and archiving to the proper storage tier (frequently access to archival)
                - Define time period to retain regular access to logs or to rotate to the archive
                - Establish a process exception mechanism when log deletion or archiving may be required
                #### Adding new logs into the log storage
                - Define a process to add new logs to the log storage
                - Build a mechanism to store new logs into the log storage
                - Automate the addition of new logs to your log storage
                #### Granting access to the logs
                - Grant read-only accesses by role/user using the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)
                - Provide read access to the logs in order to perform analysis or an audit (internal/external)
                - Automate temporary read-only access to specific log in the log storage by owner or use case

                  - Allow trusted employee to modify IAM role for an application, but within boundaries
                  - Administrator defines a set permission "dynamodb:PutItem", "dynamodb:UpdateItem", "dynamodb:DeleteItem"
                  - Developer can set a role with "dynamodb:*" but it will be restricted to the permissions above
                  - Steps for IAM administrator:
                    - Define the permissions boundary by creating a customer-managed policy.
                    - Create and attach a permissions policy to allow an employee to create roles, but only with a permissions boundary and a name that meets a specific convention.
                    - Create and attach a permissions policy to allow an employee to pass this role to Amazon EC2.
                  - Steps for Employee:
                    - Create a role with the required permissions boundary.
                    - Attach a permissions policy to the role.

                  - RBAC defines permissions based on a person's job function
                  - Attribute-based access control (ABAC) determines access to resources based on attributes.
                ### IAM
                - [What is ABAC for AWS?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html)
                  - You can attach tags to IAM resources, including IAM entities (users or roles) and to AWS resources.
                  - ABAC policies can be designed to allow operations when the principal's tag matches the resource tag
                  - Use employee attributes from your corporate directory with ABAC. You can configure your SAML-based or web identity provider to pass session tags to AWS. When your employees federate into AWS, their attributes are applied to their resulting principal in AWS. You can then use ABAC to allow or deny permissions based on those attributes.
