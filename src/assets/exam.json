Basically, all the instances are stopped, and then the latest version is installed.\n#### Pros\n- Do not need new infrastructure\n- Minimizes infrastructure costs and management overhead\n#### Cons\n- Application availability is affected\n- Rollback (You need to install again the old version)\n### __Blue/Green Deployments__\nIn this strategy, you have two separate but identical environments (Environment Blue and Green). \n- __[Environment Green]__: running current application version; \n- __[Environment Blue]__: running the new application version.\n#### Pros\n- Application availability is not affected\n- Reduces deployment risk (easy rollback, just need to swap URL)\n- Zero downtime\n#### Cons\n- Deployment time\n- Extra cost\n\nAfter the green environment is ready and tested, production traffic is redirected from blue to green. If any problem is found, you can redirect the traffic to the blue environment again.\n\n### __Canary Deployments__\nThis is a subset of Blue/Green deployment. The only difference is, you redirect just a percentage of the users for the green environment (could be 10% or something), the other users (90%) stays in the blue environment. If the green environment is not operating as expected, you can route the 10% traffic back to the blue environment. The big advantage of this strategy, only a small percentage of the users were impacted.\n#### Pros\n- Application availability is not affected\n- Reduces deployment risk (easy rollback, just need to swap URL)\n- Zero downtime\n- Just a small percentage of the users are impacted if the new environment is not working as expected.\n#### Cons\n- Deployment time\n- Extra cost\n\n### __Linear Deployments__\nThis is a subset of Blue/Green deployment. Just like canary deployment, but with this strategy the traffic is shifted in equal increments with an equal number of minutes between each increment. Something like every 3 minutes 10% of traffic will be shifted from Blue to Green environment until achieving 100%.\n#### Pros\n- Application availability is not affected\n- Reduces deployment risk (easy rollback, just need to swap URL)\n- Zero downtime\n- Just a small percentage of the users are impacted if the new environment is not working as expected.\n#### Cons\n- Deployment time\n- Extra cost\n\n### __All-at-once Deployments__\nThis is another subset of Blue/Green deployment, but all traﬃc is shifted from the original task set to the updated task set all at once, instead of shift the traffic in small steps.\n#### Pros\n- Application availability is not affected\n- Reduces deployment risk (easy rollback, just need to swap URL)\n- Zero downtime\n#### Cons\n- Deployment time (Within the Blue/Green deployments this is the faster one)\n- Extra cost\n\n### Deployment on Services\n- [CodeDeploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployment-configurations.html)\n- [AutoScaling Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatepolicy.html#cfn-attributes-updatepolicy-replacingupdate)\n- Amazon EC2\n- Amazon Elastic Container Service [Amazon ECS]\n- [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service [Amazon EKS]](https://awstip.com/best-deployment-strategies-on-aws-eks-roll-out-like-a-pro-bd2d9deadc01)\n- [Amazon Lambda](https://lumigo.io/aws-lambda-deployment/canary-deployment-for-aws-lambda/)\n",
